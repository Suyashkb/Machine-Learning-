# Malignant-and-Benign-skin-cancer-binary-Classification-CNN-
This project involved the development of a neural network using TensorFlow/Keras for the classification of cancer tumors into malignant or benign categories. The model was trained on a dataset comprising 1,800 labeled tumor images. Notable components of the architecture included Dense, Dropout, Flatten, and Xception layers. Through rigorous data preprocessing, hyperparameter optimization, and the utilization of pre-trained deep learning models, the model achieved a high accuracy of 96.73%. This project underscores the practical application of deep learning in medical image classification, demonstrating potential value in aiding medical professionals in early disease diagnosis and management. It showcases competence in machine learning and image classification.
